Breaks in monotonicity (such as counter resets due to target restarts) are automatically adjusted for. \n\nPromQL Metrics Metadata:\ntraces_exporter_sent_spans(counter): Number of spans successfully sent to destination.\n\nPromQL Expression:\ntopk(3, sum by(cluster) (rate(traces_exporter_sent_spans{exporter=\"otlp\"}[5m])))\n\nThis query is trying to answer the question:\nWhat is the top 3 clusters that have successfully sent the most number of spans to the destination?\n";
